            <p class="text-warning text-left">
                Hello Peeps! I have something inspiring to tell you about me.

                I am Tasmiya Kousar. My parents gave me this beautiful name which means “Bismila “. I was born and raised in Mysore, Karnataka.

                <br><br>
                <span id="m2" style="color: darkred; font-weight:bold;">“Some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons “.</span>
                <br><br>
                In my early age I lost my color-tone due to sunburn. During my school days I used to get bullied just because my appearance wasn’t presentable. I had dark complexion, with lovely curls and pretty amazing boy cut. My schoolmates used a lot of names to bully me like Hey! you African. You know what? she isn’t from India. Laughs! I was young, immature It didn’t make any sense to me. But now it does. I signed up at a different school but it was the same story again. Infact, I had to listen even more worse than this.

                <br><br>
                <span id="m0" style="color:seagreen; font-weight:bold;">“A flower never thinks of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms”</span>
                <br><br>
                Well, it continued. I reached Grade 11; I was quite mature this time. Tired of being bullied every time, I decided to cover up my hair but some people do exist who are least worried about other’s feelings. Not all women can beat the other who tries to fixes another woman’s crown. People used to point at Africans and tell me Hey! Look that’s your friend, your hairs and what not? Finally, my hairs grew long and trust me now I have a bunch of those lovely curls.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span id="m1" style="color:navy;font-weight:bold;">"So, I want to convey that Instead of teaching kids how to deal with bullies, teach them not to fall prey ".</span>

                <br><br>
                As a kid everyone dreams to become something in life. I dreamed to be a pilot and of course my parents dreamed of making me a doctor. Unfortunately, none of them were fulfilled due to financial issues. At this point I realised “How money is important in life “. I moved on completed my B.E in computers and now graduated successfully. I had two options either Job or Higher Education. Unfortunately, couldn’t achieve any of those or I can say I wasn’t satisfied. Well, then I decided to follow my Passion in Fashion. Being a Muslim woman, it wasn’t easy for me as I had to go through a lot of ups and downs. But I didn’t step back. I made up my mind. Do it Now or Never. My Journey began, I started recording videos and publish them on YouTube. I felt like these aren’t going really well. I decided to make reels on Instagram too. I got the same comments here too. People weren’t happy to see me growing. I made this evil my strength and here I am Tadaaa! With 25K subscribers. Well, that’s all my hard work and thanks to my Insta Fam, My family, My Friends and all others supporters. I can’t thank you all enough for making me this successful.

                <br><br>
                I faced a lot of skin issues which I never experienced in my entire life. I was tensed and gave a thought to pause but my motivators didn’t let me drop it. I am happy that my supporters are more into my work than my appearance. I was called as “ An Influencer". Many got influenced by me. I am glad that I am influencing people. Though I am just an content creator.

                <br>
                So far it’s going good. Looking forward for the same love , support and respect. Love you all my wonderful fam.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cheers!
